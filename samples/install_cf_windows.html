	To be able to program in ColdFusion the first thing you need to do is install a ColdFusion server.  There are a couple of options available to you but the one that we are going to focus on is a local development server.  
</p>

<p>
	A local development server is free and allows you to develop ColdFusion applications that use all of ColdFusions available features.  There are, however, a few limitations, such as not being able to use the server as an external web server.  That being said, there are additional benefits to using a local ColdFusion development server, such as not needing to have IIS or apache installed but instead using the packaged web server.
</p>

<p>
	To install ColdFusion, follow the steps bellow:
</p>
