<p>
	In the first part of this hands on we are going to convert some pages to .cfm pages.  We will then add some variables and output them to the user.  Finally we will add a comment to our code.
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Rename /www/index.html to index.cfm
		</li>
		<li>
			Confirm that the ColdFusion page displays by going to http://localhost/learncfinaweek_coursefiles/www/index.cfm
		</li>
		<li>
			Open up /www/index.cfm in your code editor
		</li>
		<li>
			On line 1 write a cfset tag that sets the variable myName that has a value of your name.  The tag should look something like this: <cfset myName=”Simon” />
		</li>
		<li>
			On the next line, create another variable called myPosition and set its value to Developer.  The tag should look something like: <cfset myPosition=”Developer” />
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the text [Name] on or around line 76.  Replace [Name] with #myName#
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the text [position] on or around line 77.  Replace [position] with #myPosition#
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the page in your browser and confirm that you now see #myName# and #myPosition# displayed.
		</li>
		<li>
			In your code editor, locate the #myName# variable on or around line 76 and place a <cfoutput> tag before it and a </cfoutput> tag after it so that the code looks similar to <cfoutput>#myName#</cfoutput>
		</li>
		<li>
			Do the same for the myPosition variable on or around line 77.
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the browser and confirm that you now see your name and position displayed on the page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Go to line 2 and update the variable myPosition so that it has a value of “A Developer”.  The tag should look similar to <cfset myPosition=”A Developer” />
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the browser and confirm that you see your change.
		</li>
		<li>
			In your code editor, locate the div tag that has a class style of top-left on or around line 75.  Add a new line after this tag and write the following text: “This is where the name and position are output”
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the browser and confirm that you see this text displayed on the page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Go back to your code editor and add comments around the line of text so that it looks similar to: <!--- This is where the name and position are output --->
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the browser and confirm that the text is no longer visible on the page.
		</li>
		<li>
			In your code editor, locate the link to index.html on or around line 51.  Change the link so that it points to index.cfm.
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the link to about.html on or around line 52 and change it to point to about.cfm.
		</li>
		<li>
			Rename the about.html file to about.cfm.
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh your browser and click on the about link at the top of the page.
		</li>
		<li>
			Confirm that the about page loads.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	In this section of the hands on we will switch from tag based code to script based code and create a structure of data.  We will then output that on the page.
</p>

<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Open up about.cfm in your code editor
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate line one and write an opening and closing cfscript block.  Put  the closing cfscript tag on the second third line.  Your code should look something like this: 
<pre>
<cfscript>
</cfscript>
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			In between the opening and closing cfscript tags write the following code:
<pre>
personalInfo = {name='', dob='', address='', phonenumber='', email='', url='', skype=''};
</pre>			
		</li>
		<li>
			For each variable of the personalInfo struct provide some information. You do not have to use real information if you do not want to.
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the [Name] placeholder text on or around line 115
		</li>
		<li>
			Replace [Name] with #personalInfo.name#
		</li>
		<li>
			Replace the other placeholders with their matching variables in the personalInfo struct.
		</li>
		<li>
			Wrap all the divs with the class of clr in a cfoutput tag.  Your code should look similar to this:
<pre>
<cfoutput>
	<div class="clr"><div class="input-box">Name </div><span>#personalInfo.name#</span> </div>
	<div class="clr"><div class="input-box">Date of birth </div><span> #personalInfo.dob#</span></div>
	<div class="clr"><div class="input-box">Address</div><span> #personalInfo.address#</span></div>
	<div class="clr"><div class="input-box">Phone</div> <span>#personalInfo.phoneNumber#</span>  </div>
	<div class="clr"><div class="input-box">E-mail</div><span><a href="#">#personalInfo.email#</a></span>  </div>
	<div class="clr"><div class="input-box">Website </div> <span><a href="#">#personalInfo.website#</a></span> </div> 
	<div class="clr"><div class="box1">Skype </div> <span><a href="#">#personalInfo.skype#</a></span> </div> 
</cfoutput>
</pre>			
		</li>
		<li>
			To test that your changes have taken place, load the about.cfm file in your browser
		</li>
		<li>
			Notice that you have received a ColdFusion Error.  The error states that it has found an Invalid CFML construct.  This is due to the single # signs inside the links for email, website and skype.  ColdFusion uses the # sign to denote variables and it is trying to evaluate everything between the first # sign and the next one.  To resolve the error we must escape the single # signs.
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the link that wraps around the email output on or around line 120.
		</li>
		<li>
			Update the value of the href attribute to  ## rather than #.  You’re a tag should look similar to: <a href="##">
		</li>
		<li>
			Do this also for the website and skype links.
		</li>
		<li>
			Refresh the about.cfm page in your browser and confirm that you now see your information being displayed.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<h2>
	Homework
</h2>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Convert all remaining .html pages to .cfm pages
		</li>
		<li>
			Update all navigation links to point to the .cfm files rather than the .html files.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a structure on the Contact page that stores your address, phonenumber, email and skype information and display it on the right hand side under Contact Info.
		</li>
	</ol>
