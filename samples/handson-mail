<p>
	In this hands on we are going to add email functionality to our contact form.
</p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Open up the /www/contact.cfm file in your code editor.
		</li>
		<li>
			The first thing we need to do is create the &lt;cfmail> tag. Locate the line of code which reads ‘Form submitted successfully!’ on or around line 119.
		</li>
		<li>
			Before the <p> tags but still inside the &lt;cfelse> tag, create a &lt;cfmail> tag with the following attributes:
			<ul>
				<li>
					From=”#form.email#”
				</li>
				<li>
					To=me@domain.com
				</li>
				<li>
					Subject=”Contact Request”
				</li>
				<li>
					Type=”HTML”
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Once the tag is created we need to create our email body. After the &lt;cfmail> tag write the following HTML code:
<pre>
&lt;h2>Contact Request&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>
	From: #form.contactName# (#form.email#)
&lt;/p>	
&lt;p>
	#form.message#
&lt;/p>
</pre>			
		</li>
		<li>
			After the closing &lt;/p> tag create a closing &lt;/cfmail> tag.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once the &lt;cfmail> is created we need to set up the mail server in the ColdFusion Administrator. In your browser navigate to your ColdFusion Administrator and login.  If you are on a PC the url will most likely be http://localhost:8500/cfide/administrator/ . If you are on a mac the url will most likely be http://localhost/cfide/administrator/
		</li>
		<li>
			Click on the Mail link which is on the left hand side under server settings.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the Mail Server box enter Localhost and click submit changes.  All mail will now go through localhost which will allow us to view it in our undeliverable folder.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open up the /www/contact.cfm page in your browser.
		</li>
		<li>
			Lets test our contact form and make sure the email is being sent. Fill out all the form fields and click submit.
		</li>
		<li>
			Go back to the Mail page in the ColdFusion Administrator.
		</li>
		<li>
			Click on the View Undeliverable Mail button which is under the Mail Spool Settings Heading.
		</li>
		<li>
			The first email in the list should be the email that was just generated by the Contact form.  Click on it, if not already highlighted, and review the email body below the list.  You have now successfully sent an email.  When you have access to a mail server you can update the mail settings in the ColdFusion Administrator and it will be sent out to the intended parties.
		</li>
	</ol>
