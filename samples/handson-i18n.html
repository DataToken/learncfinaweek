	In this hands on we will change our locale and update our date and time outputs to change the display based on our locale.
</p>

<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			To be able to change the date and time formats based on our locale we need to update the functions we use for date and time output.  Open up the /www/blogpost.cfm file in your code editor.
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the blogPost.datePosted variable output on or around line x.
		</li>
		<li>
			Replace the dateFormat code with the following line of code:
<pre>
#LsdateFormat(blogPost.datePosted,'short')#
</pre>			
		</li>
		<li>
			Locate the comment.createdDateTime variable on or around line x.
		</li>
		<li>
			Change the dateformat code with the following code:
<pre>
#LsdateFormat(comment.createdDateTime,'short')#	
</pre>			
		</li>
		<li>
			Change the timeFormat code with the following code:
<pre>
#LstimeFormat(comment.createdDateTime,'medium')#
</pre>			
		</li>
		<li>
			Open up the /www/blog.cfm page in your browser.
		</li>
		<li>
			Navigate to a blog post and review the date and time output.  If you are based in the US you will probably not notice any difference.  If you are outside of the US then you will probably see a different date and time format.
		</li>
		<li>
			To allow everyone to see a change in the formatting we will create a temporary page which will change our locale.  Create a file called updateLocale.cfm in the /www/ folder.
		</li>
		<li>
			Open up the /www/updateLocale.cfm file in your code editor.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add the following line of code:
<pre>
&lt;cfset setLocale('English (UK)') /> 
</pre>			
		</li>
		<li>
			Open up the /www/updateLocale.cfm page in your browser.  You will not see any output but the new locale has been set. (Unless you are in the UK, then you should try a different locale such as Italian (Standard) )	
		</li>
		<li>
			Navigate back to the /www/blog.cfm page and click on a blog post.  You should now be able to notice that the date and time formats have changed.  The changes might be slight but they will be there.
		</li>
